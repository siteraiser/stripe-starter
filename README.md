# stripe-starter
just a quick example of card payments with no 3d verification support. 
This is just an implementation of the example #4 from here: https://stripe.dev/elements-examples/
Add your public and secret keys to the js and php files.
Create a folder named "stripe", unzip the stripe library into it and visit index.php to use the card processing (424242... works for all of the card fields). The button for apple/google pay etc is non-functional at the moment.
